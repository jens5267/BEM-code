# BEM- Theory
This BEM Code calculates the design parameter for the design of a micro wind turbine. So far it only takes given rotational speed into account and the aerodynamic parameters need to be specified.

In the next step a variable rotational speed will be implemented, as well as some more of the correction factors.
